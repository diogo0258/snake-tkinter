A game of snake using Tkinter.

By default it has 2 snakes, that can be controlled by the arrow keys and ASDW.

The playing field wraps around the edges.

![demo](https://github.com/diogo0258/snake-tkinter/raw/master/demo.png)

I wanted something that would show the snake's body as a distinct line when it's moving close to itself:

![spacing](https://github.com/diogo0258/snake-tkinter/raw/master/spacing.png) vs ![no spacing](https://github.com/diogo0258/snake-tkinter/raw/master/no-spacing.png) 

Default keys:
```
arrow keys: change direction for snake 0
ASDW:       change direction for snake 1
N/F2:       new game
Q/Esc:      quit
```

Cheers
